## Sample Project with Survey Monkey Dataset

This is a my first testing project to learn more about data analysis and python. I'll be sharing more project in my repo in the future, hope this can help everyone out there who wants to learn the same subject. Cheers.

Useful legend:
* **Data - Survey Monkey Output_edited.xlsx** - Native dataset, target output, and modified dataset
* **Test Data Manipulation.ipynb** - Python notebook file for transforming the modified dataset into target output format
* **Data Manipulation output.xlsx** - The output of the data transformation
